# Path Finding Algorithms

Python Maze solver using Deapth-first search, Breadth-first search, Best-first search, A* search and Hill climbing search.

## Requirements

Can be installed with: `python3 -m pip install requirements.txt`.

## Usage

### Generating Videos

Usage: `python3 Maze/video_generator.py path/to/mazename`.

- mazename is a file with the maze, holding the dimensios in the first line and the maze in the following ones.

### Generating Statistics

This program will return an average comparation between all algorithms for random generated mazes with sizes 50, 100, 250.
    
Usage: `python3 Maze/stats.py`
